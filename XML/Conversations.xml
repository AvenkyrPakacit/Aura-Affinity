        Oh such a particularly chosen question.

        We of Eilasalia have always seen such language as harsh, brought with strife.

        The Talvix of Einfiera often enjoy such vibrant flavour of words.

        However, my counter kindred of Octusaria on the other hand, lets just say: have less restraint.
